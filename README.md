This is a simple CRUD MVC project implemented with Spring Boot, MySQL and Thymeleaf technologies. 
The project is not finished and is under development. It is updated from time to time.

##Working Version

The application deployed at Heroku. You can try it out [HERE](https://user-service-antonchar.herokuapp.com).

> I am using the free plan, so after an hour period of inactivity the application is frozen. 
It may take some time while the application is waking up.
If you have been redirected to this page from the Heroku link, please try to visit the url again.
